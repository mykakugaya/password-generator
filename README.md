Featuring a neat and responsive user interface, this application is programmed to generate a random password based on user-selected criteria. Users choose the password length and character types to be included (at least one), then a password matching the selected criteria is written to the page. This application helps increase web security by allowing users accessing sensitive data to create strong, secure passwords.
